  <h1>Everyday I Ask</h1>
  <strong>This is an article kind layout.</strong>
  <br/>

  <p>I've been thinking about this
over and over and over.</p>
<p>I mean, really, truly,
imagine it.</p>
<p>What does that
look like in a year?
In 10 years?</p>
<p>What will happen
to your life?</p>
<p>How alone will it make you?</p>
<p>How much is that gonna cut you
off from your family?</p>
<p>How much is that gonna cut you
off from everyone you know?</p>
<p>How will it feel for you,
almost entirely alone,
and not be able to explain to anyone?</p>

  any knowledge of your actions will be disavowed.</i></p></body>
