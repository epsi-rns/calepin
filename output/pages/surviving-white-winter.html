  <h1>Surviving White Winter</h1>
  <strong>This is a page kind layout.</strong>
  <br/>
  
  <p>It was a frozen winter in cold war era.
We were two lazy men, a sleepy boy, two long haired women, a husky with attitude, and two shotguns.
After three weeks, we finally configure dzen2.</p>
<p>But we lost our beloved husky before we finally made it.
Now, every january, we remember our husky,
that helped all of us to survive.</p>
